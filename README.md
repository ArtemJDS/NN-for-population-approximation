# NN-for-population-approximation
There has been long tradition of applying ideas from stochasic differential equations (specifically Fokker-Plank equation) to simulate large ensembles of neurons, assuming them being nearly identical and receiving some noise. Here we present several methods for approximating dynamics of neuronal population based on the notion of neural network as universal function approximator.

The data used in simulations is available upon request.
